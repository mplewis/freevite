			In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form
			of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used as a placeholder before
			final copy is available. It is also used to temporarily replace text in a process called greeking, which allows
			designers to consider the form of a webpage or publication, without the meaning of the text influencing the
			design. Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC text by
			the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical and
			improper Latin.
